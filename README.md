This section introduces the notebook's purpose which is to demonstrate the use of **TIP**, the Technology Intelligence Platform. It is a real life example using data from **OPS**, the Open Patent Services from **EPO**.

By leveraging family data from Open Patent Services, OPS, and using the sunburst chart of the Plotly library, familyTree visually offers a spherical, colourful and dynamic representation of an EP / WO patent family including divisional patents and their relationships by branches and by parent-child affiliation, that can be zoomed intuitively.
